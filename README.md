# Two_Level_IoT_Network_Attack_System_Detection_Using_Deep_Learning
In this project, I developed a two level IoT network attack detection system with 1D-CNN. The level-1 model classifies the network flow as normal or attacks, while the level-2 model identifies the type of attacks. I evaluated the proposed model on the UNSW-NB15 dataset to show the effectiveness of my method. The proposed model is evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F score and found that the accuracy of Level 1 is 94.51%, whereas 80.54% for Level 2.
